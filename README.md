By Eiffel Valentino

## Running
The project was created with [Apache NetBeans IDE 21](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html) with the latest 21.0.2+13 JDK from [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).

The project folder should be opened with the IDE and Run from there.

Required File Submissions from Objective-1 (BankCustomer.java) and Objective-2 (BankAccountTransaction.java) are included in the same project.
DriverCode.java is testing both objectives.
